Your task is to create an API to search over available flights.
There are two available flightâ€™s providers:

- https://obscure-caverns-79008.herokuapp.com/cheap
- https://obscure-caverns-79008.herokuapp.com/business

Your API should aggregate return flights from both providers. Do remember about sorting, filtering and pagination.

Upload solution to any remote git repository like github, bitbucket etc.

Preferable technologies:

- Java
- Spring boot

Reminders/Tips:

- Remember about the tests
- Write a readme file
- Optimize the application
- Keep the code clean
- Keep the commit naming strategy consistent

PS:
Mocked API is deployed to free version of Heroku, so the first request can take a few more seconds
